# Mingda Magician X bugfix firmware 

NOTE: THIS IS FOR THE ST VARIANT OF THE PRINTER. GD RELEASE WILL COME SOON

Credits go to justleader for this firmware, please check out the original: https://git.justleader.eu/justleader/mmx-marlin-custom

## Fixes:
 - 🟢 **Increased thermal runaway tolerance:** Increased the tolerance of the thermal errors (runaway, mintemp, etc.) due to the inconsistency of the 20-pin x-axis gantry ribbon cable. The increase is still well within the safety margins.
 > ↑ If you need this, I highly recommend replacing the cable with a non OEM higher quality one. The manufacturer one is very poorly crimped and will break.
 - 🟢 **Overshoot Reduction:** Stock firmware leaves PID_FUNCTIONAL_RANGE at 100, which is way more than what it should be; regardless of what heater cartridge you use, there will be a large overshoot. You can adjust it yourself but (default + overshoot) is used in this build, which reduces overshoot to <3C vs 10-15C.
 - 🟠 **Bed lining clearance:** After homing the printer for an initial print, certain thinner PEI sheets will be lower than the plastic that lines the bed to prevent it from moving. The nozzle now moves X=Y=10mm to prevent itself from lowering the Z too fast and hitting the plastic (only when print starts).  
 - 🔴 **GT Support:** TBD. 
 - 🔴 **UI stuff:** Put more settings on the front page for easy access.

ℹ️ If you want to modify and build this yourself, use platform.io extension in visual studio code.

## How to install:
 - Make sure your printer is the ST variant by checking the **information** menu in your printer; if your model number is followed by **(S)**, then this will work. 
 - Check out the **firmware.bin** in the releases tab.
 - Place on SD card and restart your printer.
 - The firmware file will be renamed to **firmware.cur** if successful; remove this file from your SD card.
 - **IMPORTANT:** Run PID tuning using the controller application of your choice. Here are my recommended gcode commands that work fairly well:
```
   - M303 E0 S220 C8
   - M301 P<value> I<value> D<value> ; Replace with results
   - M500
```

## Other customizations (by ![justleader](https://git.justleader.eu/justleader))
 - Ready message: line 210 in Marlin/Configuration.h
   ```
     #define CUSTOM_MACHINE_NAME "MD D301 F4"
   ```
- Changing version:
  - Version information is changed in Marlin/src/inc/Version.h
- Reverting to old main status screen
  - Uncomment `#define USEOLDSTATUSSCREEN` at the top in Marlin/Configuration.h, custom settings are at the top, before the Marlin configuration

## Current issues
 - Overshoot tuning, I believe this is beyond the regular PID constant tuning. Hopefully the next build fixes this.

## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
